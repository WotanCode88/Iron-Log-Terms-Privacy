Thank you for using Iron Log. This Privacy Policy explains how Iron Log handles information.
Iron Log is designed to work without transmitting or storing user data on external servers.

1. Information we collect

Iron Log does not collect or send personal data to any server.

All data you enter in the App (workouts, measurements, logs, notes) is stored locally on your device only.
We do not have access to this data.

2. No analytics, no tracking, no third-party data collection

Iron Log:
    •    does not include analytics SDKs
    •    does not contain third-party trackers
    •    does not send app usage data or diagnostics anywhere
    •    does not use a remote backend

3. Subscriptions and payments

Subscriptions and in-app purchases are processed by Apple through StoreKit.
    •    We do not receive payment information
    •    Billing follows Apple’s terms and policies
    •    Subscriptions can be managed in your Apple ID account settings

4. Data retention and deletion

All data remains on your device.
    •    Deleting the App removes all user data permanently
    •    We cannot access, retrieve, or delete your data, because it is not stored on our servers

We rely on Apple’s built-in iOS security features, including:
    •    device encryption
