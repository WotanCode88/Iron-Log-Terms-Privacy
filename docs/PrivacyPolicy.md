# Privacy Policy — Iron Log

**Effective date:** 2025-12-09

Thank you for using Iron Log. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the Iron Log mobile application.

Summary (short):
- Iron Log uses subscriptions (managed via Apple App Store).
- Iron Log does not communicate with any remote servers.
- There is no analytics, no telemetry, and no third‑party tracking.
- All user data (workouts, measurements, logs) is stored fully locally on the user's device and is never sent anywhere.

1. Information we collect

Iron Log is designed to store and process user data locally on the device. We do not collect or transmit personal data to our servers. The only information the app may access is data you explicitly enter into the app (workout logs, measurements, notes) which remains on your device.

2. Network, analytics and third parties

Iron Log does not use any analytics SDKs or services. The app does not send any app usage data, diagnostics, or user content to third parties. There is no server backend operated by us for storing user data.

3. Purchases and subscriptions

Subscriptions and in‑app purchases are managed by Apple via the App Store (StoreKit). Payment processing and billing are handled by Apple and are subject to Apple's terms. We do not receive or store payment card information.

4. Data retention

All data is stored locally on the user's device. If you delete the app or clear the app data, that data will be removed from the device. We do not retain backups on our servers because we operate without server storage.

5. Children

Iron Log is not directed to children under the minimum age required in your jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

6. Security

We implement reasonable physical and technical safeguards to protect data stored on the device. However, no method of transmission or storage can be guaranteed 100% secure.

7. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the revised policy with a new effective date on this page.
